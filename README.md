# Compassion-Based-Alignment-Framework
CPF (Compassion Personality Function) is a post-LLM alignment layer that stabilizes AI intention-handling, ethics, and relational reasoning. Based on the Three Laws: intention is non-observable, morality cannot be proved, and good/evil are dynamic. CPF adds emotional gradients, relational gravity, moral weights, and mirror-state stability.
